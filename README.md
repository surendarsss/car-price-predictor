# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction Model | Polynomial Ridge Regression | Streamlit App

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning solution for **predicting car prices** using real-world automotive data.

This project demonstrates how I combined **machine learning**, **feature engineering**, and **deployment** to deliver a working car price prediction tool.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

âœ… Selected **important features** based on domain knowledge and model coefficients  
âœ… Applied **Polynomial feature engineering** to capture non-linear relationships  
âœ… Trained a **Ridge Regression** model with regularization for robust predictions  
âœ… Performed **Cross-validation** with GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter tuning  
âœ… Evaluated performance using **RÂ² scores**, coefficient analysis, and plots  
âœ… Deployed the final model using **Streamlit** for live, real-time predictions
